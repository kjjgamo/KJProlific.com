        <h8><br><br />Fortnite Skills</h8>
        <p>I am actually very good at Boxfights and I have fast edits. Most of the time my aim is on point and I can hit easy headshots. About a month ago I didn't know how to do any highground retakes, but then I looked at videos and learned them fast. I would say that I am a decent builder and I can get tricks down fast. And the last is that I am veryyyyyyyyyy good at sniping!</p>
          <h9><br><br />Arena Points</h9> g
          <p>To get a lot of arena points and possibly get to chapmion league, you just want to rush people and wkey all of your games. I know you will lose points and gain points, but also as you are playing you are also improving at the game so that way after a couple days, you can be gaining as many points as you want. By that time, you can basically just play whatever playstyle you would like to play. So you could play for placement poi5s and get wins or you can wkey to get even better at the game or you could try to get clips for a montage.</p>
        <h10><br><br />Best Loadouts</h10>
        <p> Loadout number 1: You would want to cary a regular AR, a charge shotgun, a sniper or shockwave grenades, and heals.<br><br />Loadout Number 2:For this loadout you would want to carry a heavy ar and a tactical shotun.</p>
        <h11><br><br />How to master the charge shotgun meta</h11>
        <p>With the charge shotgun you need to know how to time edits and look for good shotgun peaks. You also have to be patient with your shots and look for the best shot you can get so you can deal the most damage to your opponent. This means that you basically just have to utilize your cove when using the gun. The best edit you can make is the right corner edit.</p>

          <h14><br><br >/Bginners Guide to Arena and Competetive.
            <p>You always want to keep a good mindset when playing arena and tournamets. You also want to do od reviews on your gameplay. Also when you get on after you do your warmup you would want to do solos or duo scrims for endgme practice, or practice in general. When in fights you want to learn how to take walls and use piece control so you can block off an opponents ways to escape. It's also good to secure your opponent and the kill. One thing you never want to do when engaging in a fight i to neve overbuild. 1: It's a waste of mateials. 2: You can easily get knocked down form the person below you. 3: You can also lose track of your opponent. Another way you can do better in arena is to be patient with your shots, and don't rush them because you can easily miss out on big shots if you quickly just rush your shot and potentialy miss. Another crucial tip you could use is when not playing Fortnite you could be doing brain excercises to build up your memory and then when you get in a game and start building, you could remember pieces tjat you placed and edit them to go for sneaky shots. You could also do Practice Techniques & Positioning while in creative playing zone wars or just playing scrims.
