        <h8><br><br />Fortnite Skills</h8>
        <p>I am actually very good at Boxfights and I have fast edits. Most of the time my aim is on point and I can hit easy headshots. About a month ago I didn't know how to do any highground retakes, but then I looked at videos and learned them fast. I would say that I am a decent builder and I can get tricks down fast. And the last is that I am veryyyyyyyyyy good at sniping!</p>
          <h9><br><br />Arena Points</h9> g
          <p>To get a lot of arena points and possibly get to chapmion league, you just want to rush people and wkey all of your games. I know you will lose points and gain points, but also as you are playing you are also improving at the game so that way after a couple days, you can be gaining as many points as you want. By that time, you can basically just play whatever playstyle you would like to play. So you could play for placement poi5s and get wins or you can wkey to get even better at the game or you could try to get clips for a montage.</p>
        <h10><br><br />Best Loadouts</h10>
        <p> Loadout number 1: You would want to cary a regular AR, a charge shotgun, a sniper or shockwave grenades, and heals.<br><br />Loadout Number 2:For this loadout you would want to carry a heavy ar and a tactical shotun.</p>
        <h11><br><br />How to master the charge shotgun meta</h11>lo
        <p>With the charge shotgun you need to know how to time edits and look for good shotgun peaks. You also have to be patient with your shots and look for the best shot you can get so you can deal the most damage to your opponent. This means that you basically just have to utilize your cove when using the gun. The best edit you can make is the right corner edit.</p>

          <h14><br><br />Beginners Guide to Arena and Competetive.
            <p>You always want to keep a good mindset when playing arena and tournamets. You also want to do od reviews on your gameplay. Also when you get on after you do your warmup you would want to do solos or duo scrims for endgme practice, or practice in general. When in fights you want to learn how to take walls and use piece control so you can block off an opponents ways to escape. It's also good to secure your opponent and the kill. One thing you never want to do when engaging in a fight i to neve overbuild. 1: It's a waste of mateials. 2: You can easily get knocked down form the person below you. 3: You can also lose track of your opponent. Another way you can do better in arena is to be patient with your shots, and don't rush them because you can easily miss out on big shots if you quickly just rush your shot and potentialy miss. Another crucial tip you could use is when not playing Fortnite you could be doing brain excercises to build up your memory and then when you get in a game and start building, you could remember pieces tjat you placed and edit them to go for sneaky shots. You could also do Practice Techniques & Positioning while in creative playing zone wars or just playing scrims.
            <h15><br><br />How to make it to endgame</h15>
              <p> You should land at a decent spot on the edge of the mao, with decent loot, so you can rotate safely in arena and tournaments. While you are there you want to look for mobility and get maxed mats. After that you want to rotate dead side. Dead side is the side where the least amount of players are rotating.  
                <h16><br><br />How to qualify for tournaments</h16>
                <p>When starting a tournament, you always want to wkey people in your first match. and then you can create your own playstyle for the rest of the session.</p>
            <h17><br><br />How to stay consistent in arena games and tournaments</h17>
            <p>The first thing you have to do is to just play arena. No creative. I say this because your not going to have unlimited mats in creative, and your not going to have that pressure on you like you usually do in arena because you just spawn back into
              <h18><br><br />Season 6 Competetive Changes</h18>
              <p>First, fortite needs to bring the pump back in season 6. Then they need to communicate with their fansbase, and put out good detailed patch notes, and good updates. They aso need to raise their prize pools, because now if you get in 1st place in tournament, you can only maake, like, $2,000. 
                <h19><br><br />The differences between you and a fortnite pro</h19>
                <p>Most pros usually go into creative and start off with their building, editing,aiming, and movement mechanics. You can practice your movement mechanics in boxfights. Most pros also grind out arena whenever they get on, so when you get on I advise you to use your time wisely and grind arena. Also, make sure that you play any tournament you can, because it can give you a lot of practice to do better in upcoming tournaments. Another thing that pros do is grind the game a lot, and stay motivated. You need to put in the hours, and the work to get any benefit from this game, and you need to stay motivated while doing so, or else you will eventually become demotivated and not want to want grind anymore, and you will fall off. So that's why you should stay consistent when grinding in Fortnite.</p>  
            <h20><br><br />Types of players in a trio.</h20>
                  <p>There are 3 types of players in a trio. There is a support player, a fragger, and an igl (In Game Leader). The support player usually carries all of the meds, and shelids. The igl is usually the person that tells everyone what to do in game and makes the decisions. They are also the one who tunnels in the end game. The fragger is the oe who looks for the kills during the game, and mostly in end game.</p>
            <h21><br><br />Arena Playstyle to Champs</h21>
            <p> The best modes to play in arena are duos, and solos, because if you are a wkeyer then you can gain more points when you get a kill in solos and duos, than you can in trios.</p>
              <h22><br><br />How to qualify for 2021 FNCS</h22>
              <p>If you want to qualify for fncs, you really just want to play placement. By playing placement, you can easily gain a lot of points by making it to end game in all of the rounds, and then the fragger of the team can frag out for smart kills.</p>
            <h23><br><br />How to dominate in fncs</h23>
            <p>First you have to make sure that you have the perfect trio. Obviously when finding a trio, you need to look for people that you guys are good at different things. You also need to make sure that you guys get along, you guys are not toxic, and that you guys can take constructive criticism.. Your teamates should also have good chemisry with you and have to enjoy playing with each other. Next tip is to be able to practice efficiently. When practicing you guys need to make sure you can practice productivly.  When you guys are all on the game, you want to make sure that you guys are scrimming and practicing in creative together as often as you can. While in creative with your teamates, you should mostly play against each other to find out each others skills, and see what they are good at, so you will learn each others strengths and weaknesses. The next tip is to keep a good mindset. When one of the players in the team has a bad mindset and brings bad energy into the game, then that could bring everyone else down, and even their game with them. Staying positive and keeping in mind that anything can happen at any point and time, is a good way in keeping youselves motivated. Another thing that you uys could do together is go into discord, share your screen, and do a vod review together, and go over your gameplay. You guys could also go into other pros' steams or look at their hilight videos and see what they do to win compared to how you do when playing.</p>
            <h24><br><br />Solo and Trio Test Event</h24> 
            <p>The trio and solo test events are just for practice in a real tournament, and there is no prize pool. Another thing is, is that, The score of points is not going to be saved in the history.</p>
            <h25><br><br />Mistakes I make in Tournaments</h25>
            <p>I don't end fights quick enough, and I don't have enough mats when i'm fighting. I need to rotate to zone fast and on the dead side. I need to learn how to rotate in the end game. I need to win more of my off spawn fights. I need to get better at fighting in games. I need to learn to stop fighting out of circle. I need to learn when to play passive and when to wkey. I need to use my mats wisely and rotaions wisely. I need to learn to fish in the early game so that I have enough healables in the late game. I need to carry more necessary things with me to the end game. I need to wkey smarter.</p>  
            <h26><br><br />How to Reach Champions League Easily and Productivley</h27>
            <p>First you need to learn which playstyle you are most comfortable with. You can either play for placement, and to do this you will need to learn how to rotate dead side, and stay away from fights. If you are wkeying, then you want to get better at fighting, and if you are a passive and agressive player, then you will need to learn when to push people, and when to fall back. After that you will need to create a decent drop spot, and loot route. After you establish your loot route, you then want to decide what you want to do. This all depends on where your circle is and how much time the zone has to close in.</p>
            <h27><br><br />How to speedrun to champs before fncs</h27>
            <p>You want to learn to recover from bad landings, when dropping out of the battle bus. Then you always want to box up and heal after trading damage in a fight. You want to chase tunnelers safely in endgame.</p>
            <h28><br><br />How to get out of Division 7</h28>
            <p>One strategy you want to use is hitting your opponent with chip damage. Chip damage is when you are slowly chipping away at your opponents health, with smart shots that don't put you at risk.  Another thing that you want to do is to prioritize your mats, when fighting.</body>
        <h29><br><br />How to Imrpove Your Mechanics in Fortnite</h29>
        <p>One thing that you would want to do is just to change a little bit of things in your keybinds. When you do this, it will give you a challenge and you will learn new things when doing these challenges. Another thing that youw ant to do is play against better ;players more. One way you could do this is to go into discord and look for people that are better than you. Another way you could do this is to play with another friend that is in champions league and play arena duos with them so you could wkey some good people that are in champs. When you are fighting against better players than you, you can learn their techniques and gain their good habits in fighting. A mechanic that you really want to train is our aim. It is the aim because thats basically the only way you can kill somone.</p>
        <h30><br><br />Vod Review: Mistakes I Make</h30>
        <p>I don't end fights quick enough, and I panic too much when I get into fights. I should start playing scrims to practice for endgame, because I need to learn to stay with my team for endgame. Me and my team need to learn to stay with eachother during fights, and communicate better. I need to get more materials in the beginning of the game so I can start out fights with maxed mats. I also need to start playing out my part as the support player instead of trying to frag out. Since we are playing trio games, then we should learn to gte our finishes on peoplle that we knock. We need to start playing boxfights together so we can learn to stay together in a box, and commuincat on who is doing what inside of it., We also need to learn when to rotate and use our rotations wisley so we don't get shot at.</p>
        <h31><br><br />How to Play Endgames.</h31>
        <p>When you are landing at a house that is contesed, the first thing you want to do when you land is find a gun, THEN you can go get mats. What you want to do if you are in a boxfight, then you want to expand and not be greedy with loot when you are IN a fight. Build your base in the center of the 3rd zone because, in the 4th zone, the circle will be in either corner or in the circle. You should practice you aim for the end games, when you get ready to get tags on people. Don't waste your mats on bad tunneling. Get into 2 boxes to confuse your oponent on which one he is in. I aslo need to stay with my team during rotations. When we rotate, we want to rotate deadside. We should learn to drop mats for the igl, when they are tarping in the endgame. I also need to learn how to use zero point crystals as rotations instead of using the sand to rotate.</p>
        <h32><br><br /> Tips for Arena</h32>
        <p>You always need to check for loot spawns because, there can be any loot for you. You need to kills the legendary sharks that you can find because they can also drop good loot. Aother tip is to memorize your storm surge numbers. You also want to throw 2 gas cans, instead of one, because one of them will be able to attack you through your box. You don't want to back out of your gane, because most of the people back out of their gmes so they can play more and then get to their last game, but when you don't do this, you can get the fullest of your points by wkeying, THEN you can get into your next game. One reason why creative warriors aren't good in real games is because they actually are bad at fighting in them, because they are so used to be playing in unrealistic scenarios, like using the pump shotgun in a season where we are using tacs, charges, and lever actions.</p>
        <h33><br><br />How I can do good in the braging rights tournament</h33>
        <p>The gameplan for this tournament for our team is to just, land at Misty Meadows every game, and then do smart wkeying, to practice for our cash cups, since this is just a bragging right tournament. And then in the nedgames we need to learn to tarp as a team, and take and keep highround. Another thing that we can practice on is getting better with different guns.</p>
